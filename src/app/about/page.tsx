            Whenever conversations turned to the Prophets, I&rsquo;d often find myself
            in a familiar struggle. <br />
            Sometimes, a story would come to mind instantly like the Prophet who
            spoke to an ant 🐜 clear as day. <br />
            But at other times, when I tried to remember which Prophet could
            soften iron with his hands 🛠️, my mind would go completely blank.
            <br />
            <br />
            I&rsquo;d try so hard to recall&hellip; but nothing would come. Just silence.
            <br />
            And in those moments, a wave of embarrassment would wash over me 🌊.
            Sometimes, even a deep shame. <br />
            I truly wanted to ask someone. I needed to. But a quiet, nagging
            voice in my head would whisper: <br />
            <i>&ldquo;How can you forget this? This is basic Islam.&rdquo;</i> <br />
            <i>&ldquo;What kind of Muslim doesn&rsquo;t remember the Prophets?&rdquo; 🕊️</i>
            <br />
            <br />
            So, I stayed quiet. I held that shame inside&mdash;a secret burden I
            didn&rsquo;t dare share. <br />
            But then, one day, something shifted. <br />A gentle thought bloomed
            in my heart 🌸. A soft whisper asked: <br />
            <i>&ldquo;What if I&rsquo;m not the only one who forgets?&rdquo;</i> <br />
            <i>&ldquo;What if someone else out there also struggles like me?&rdquo;</i>
            <br />
            <i>&ldquo;What if they&rsquo;re too afraid to ask just like I was?&rdquo;</i> <br />
            <br />
            That quiet moment, that small realization, changed something deep
            within me. <br />
            And that&rsquo;s how <b>Zuhraa</b> was born. <br />
            <br />
            <b>Zuhraa</b> is a gentle space crafted from my own heart, <br />
            for anyone who&rsquo;s ever forgotten, <br />
            for anyone who deeply wants to remember, and <br />

            Where did the name <b>&quot;Zuhraa&quot;</b> come from? <br />

            🌙 <b>Zuhraa &mdash; a name born from light</b> <br />
            <br />
            Zuhraa is not just an app. It&rsquo;s a gentle space 🧡. <br />
            It&rsquo;s a return to what your soul might be yearning for 🌠. <br />
            But first... why the name Zuhraa? <br />
            <br />
            The name was first inspired by <b>Fatima al-Zahra (R.A.)</b> 🕊️ <br />
            The daughter of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. <br />
            She was known as <i>al-Zahra</i>, meaning <i>&ldquo;The Radiant.&rdquo;</i> 🌟 <br />
            A woman of unmatched strength, purity, and light. <br />
            Whose legacy continues to glow through generations. <br />
            Her name carries a timeless softness that felt like the perfect
            beginning. <br />
            <br />
            But there&rsquo;s a second light behind the name&hellip; <br />
            It&rsquo;s also named after someone deeply precious to me, my friend{" "}
            <b>Fatima Zahraa</b>. <br />
            Her presence in my life has been a reflection of calmness, comfort,
            and courage 🌸. <br />
            Her name, her soul&mdash;they became part of this dream without even
            trying. <br />I love her deeply, and this is my quiet way of saying{" "}
            <b>Thank you for existing.</b> 🤍
